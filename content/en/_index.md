## What is Biofabrication? üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

Biofabrication allows us to "grow" compostable and sustainable packaging materials, using two ingredients: mushrooms (mycelium) and vineyard waste (vine pruning).

---

## The Material and Its Benefits

Our material is completely natural, compostable, and tailored for the wine industry, providing an eco-friendly alternative to traditional packaging.

---

## The Process

1. **Growing the Material**: Using mushrooms and agricultural residues.
2. **Molding and Shaping**: The material is molded to fit packaging needs.
3. **Drying and Curing**: The material is dried to create a strong structure.
