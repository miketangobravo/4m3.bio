## Biofabrication! 
üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

We "grow" compostable and sustainable wine packaging materials, using two ingredients: 

mycelium (fungi) and 
vineyard waste (vine pruning).

---

## Real Impact!

Reduce environmental damage.

Biopackaging is stronger than styrofoam, lighter than wood, and does not require an outer cardboard container. 

Protect your wine from smacks, vibrations, and temperature swings.

Engage customers with an unboxing experience that tells your vineyard's story and wine's origin. 

Grow boxes at your winery, using your own vineyard waste.

## Our Goal: Empower Wineries to Grow Their Own Boxes

For 10,000 years, crushed grapes and fungi (yeast) have produced wine: üçÑ+üçá=üç∑

Now, wineries can make wine and grow packaging from the SAME vines: üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

---

## The Process is Simple

1. Shred your vine pruning into a mulch.
2. Clean the shredded pruning, and mix with a small amount of fungi-inoculated seeds.
3. Place the mixture into a wine-box mould, and wait 5 days for the mycelium to colonize the mulch. 
4. Remove the newly grown biopackaging from the mould and allow to dry.
5. Heat the box to 80ÀöC, to remove any remaining moisture and stop further mycelial growth.
6. Ship your wines around the world!
