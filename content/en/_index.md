## What is Biofabrication? üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

Biofabrication allows us to "grow" compostable and sustainable packaging materials, using only two ingredients: mushrooms (mycelium) and vineyard waste (vine pruning).

---

## Protect your wine

Our mycelium packaging is stronger than styrofoam, lighter than wood, and does not require an outer cardboard container. These boxes, you can grow yourself, protect your wine from vibrations, temperature swings, and impacts.

---

## The Process is Simple

1. Shred your vine pruning into a mulch.
2. Mix the shredded pruning with a tiny amount of fungi-inoculated seeds and water.
3. Place this mixture into your customized, wine-box mould, and wait 5 days for the mycelium to colonize the vineyard waste. 
4. Remove the newly grown mycelium packaging from the mould and allow to dry.
5. Heat the box to 80ÀöC, to remove any remaining moisture and stop mycelium growth.
6. Ship your wines around the world!

## Our Goal: Empower Wineries to Grow Their Own Boxes

We enable wineries to cultivate their own sustainable packaging.

For 10,000 years, crushed grapes and fungi (yeast) have produced wine: üçÑ+üçá=üç∑
Now, wineries can make wine and grow packaging from the SAME vines: üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

## What We‚Äôre Looking For:

- **Primier Partner Winery** Your winery will be the FIRST in the world to use mycelium packaging. We will grow your first 1000 boxes for you, and teach you the process. Your brand will bring this technology to the world, and we will join you on stage at the world's wine events to support the announcement. 
- **Wineries** interested in growing their own boxes in the future.

## What We‚Äôve Accomplished So Far

We‚Äôve developed prototypes and achieved promising results in the production of biofabricated boxes.
