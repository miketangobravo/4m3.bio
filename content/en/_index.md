## Biofabrication! 
üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

We "grow" compostable and sustainable wine packaging materials, using two ingredients: 

mycelium (fungi) and 
vineyard waste (vine pruning).

## Protect your wine

Biopackaging is stronger than styrofoam, lighter than wood, and does not require an outer cardboard container. 

These boxes protect your wine from vibrations, temperature swings, and impacts, and are ready to ship to retailers and customers.

They can be grown at the winery, using your own vineyard waste.

---

## The Process is Simple

1. Shred your vine pruning into a mulch.
2. Clean the shredded pruning, and mix with a small amount of fungi-inoculated seeds.
3. Place the mixture into a wine-box mould, and wait 5 days for the mycelium to colonize the vineyard cuttings. 
4. Remove the newly grown biopackaging from the mould and allow to dry.
5. Heat the box to 80ÀöC, to remove any remaining moisture and stop further mycelial growth.
6. Ship your wines around the world!

## Our Goal: Empower Wineries to Grow Their Own Boxes

We enable wineries to GROW their own sustainable packaging.

For 10,000 years, crushed grapes and fungi (yeast) have produced wine: üçÑ+üçá=üç∑

Now, wineries can make wine and grow packaging from the SAME vines: üçÑ+üçá=üì¶

## We‚Äôre Looking For:

Our Premier Winery Partner

We are looking for the FIRST winery in the world to use mycelium biopackaging. 

We will help you grow your first 1000 boxes, and teach you the process. Your brand will bring this technology to the world, and we will join you on stage at the world's wine events, to support the announcement.
